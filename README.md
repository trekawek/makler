Makler is an Android application displaying current Warsaw Stock Exchange
quotations. It is available on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.net.newton.Makler&hl=pl).

`master` branch contains unstable, refactored version of the application.
In the future it'll become the main Google Play branch. `legacy-2.7`
branch contains currently released app - according to the name, it
contains a lot of legacy and dirty things.

In the past Makler was integrated with a few stock market account
providers (mBank, PKO BP, BRE Bank, etc.). However, over the time the
cost of integration became too high and banks launched their own mobile
apps, so right now Makler can be used only for displaying delayed
quotations.
